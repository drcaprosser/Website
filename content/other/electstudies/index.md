In 2023 I joined the editorial board of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/electoral-studies" target="_blank"><em>Electoral Studies</em></a>. Mostly that means I [review](/other/review/) lots of papers.

From 2013-15 I also worked as a editorial assistant for *Electoral Studies*, working under Geoff Evans. If you submitted a paper during that period you're welcome for the speedy processing of your paper/sorry it took so long to proceess your paper (delete as appropriate).
