<p>Like many academics, I spend some of my time reviewing submissions for academic journals, publishers, and funding bodies. I also like measuring things and keeping track of them, even if there’s no point in doing so.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I think it can be useful to share this sort of information – no one really knows how much reviewing other people do, which makes it hard to know if you are doing a lot or a little of something. I have no idea if I do more or less reviewing than other people in my field, but in any case, here is a brief record of the review I have done during my career.</p>
<p>I reviewed my first paper for a journal in 2012, and since then I have reviewed 142 submissions for 46 different journals. That works out as about 11.4 reviews per year since I started reviewing, and 15.9 per year in the last five years.</p>
<p>Here’s a plot of how many reviews I’ve done over time:</p>

<p>And here are the ten journals I’ve reviewed for the most:</p>

<p>I’ve also reviewed seven book proposals for four different publishers, and six grant proposals for four different funding bodies.</p>
<p>I’m almost always happy to review things if they are related to things I know about, so if you’re looking for someone to review something, feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>, especially if you’re a book publisher who’ll give me free books in return for a review. I love books.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Once I had enough data I tried to do some analysis to see what factors led to more sleep. Unfortunately it turns out babies are entirely random processes.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I worked in a bookshop for five years while I was a student, which has left me with the habit of buying more books than I will ever have time to read, something you will discover for yourself if you ever come to my house or office.<br><br> A couple of years ago I started pointless keeping track of the (non-work) books I read on the Story Graph, so if you want to know what I’ve been reading lately, <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/caprosser" target="_blank">take a look</a>. Also feel free to talk to me about any of the books I’ve read!<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
