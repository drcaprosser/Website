In 2025 I became one of the trustees of the McDougall Trust, a small charity which exists to advance knowledge and understanding of electoral democracy.

The trust:
- Owns the academic journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rrep20/about-this-journal" target="_blank"><em>Representation</em></a>. 
- Funds the annual McDougall Fund Prize awarded by the Political Studies Association for a PhD thesis about elections, electoral systems and representation.
- Held a substantial archive of material relating to elections and electoral reform, including the earliest records of the Proportional Representation Society and the Electoral Reform Society. Most of the material was recently transferred to the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/news/?newsItem=8a1785d78ce92907018d3b388e9962de" target="_blank">Modern Records Centre</a> at the University of Warwick.
- Encourages, supports, and provids research about electoral democracy.
