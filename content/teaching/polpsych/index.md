This is a postgraduate module introducing students to the field of political psychology -- an interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics that sits at the intersection of political science and psychology.
Political psychologists tackle many important questions that cover a wide range of political subjects, such as:

-   Are political preferences innate?
-   Why are some people liberal whilst others are conservative?
-   Why do people respond to the same political news in different ways?
-   Why do political partisans hate each other?
-   Are racism and discrimination inevitable?
-   Why do people engage in political violence?
-   Are political leaders normal people?

We examine answers to these questions that draw on a wide range of theoretical and empirical approaches, from genetic inheritance and physiological predisposition, to the influence of social groups and motivated reasoning.

In the first part of the course we examine the major theoretical and empirical approaches to studying political psychology, drawing on genetics, physiology, and cognitive, social, and moral psychology.
In the second part, we apply the insights from these approaches to three important areas of politics: discrimination and inter-group conflict, terrorism and political violence, and the study of political elites.
